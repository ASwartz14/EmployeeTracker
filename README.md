## Description

An employee management system. I used inquirer to prompt questions to be answered about employees, roles, and departments. Use to keep track of names, ids, roles, and salaries. Still need to add update and delete functions.

- See the project repository: https://github.com/ASwartz14/EmployeeTracker on GitHub.
